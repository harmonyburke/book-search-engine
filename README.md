Enter the title of a book in the search bar to search for it. If you would like to save it, you will need to log in or sign up to save. Once saved, you can see your saved book titles.


*currently the webpage is down due to a syntax error. Once this error is located, the webpage will be back up and running!

## Credits
To create this application, I refered to module 21 coursework, React documentation, and received help from Andrew Hudgins-TA.
